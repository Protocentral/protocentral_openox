Protocentral OpenOx is a new standalone, wireless pulse oximetry breakout board that is powered by the ubiquitous ESP32 WROOM32 module and uses the AFE4490 IC to measure oxygen levels in the blood while also providing a PPG waveform, heart rate, and SpO2 values measured with high precision. 

Protocentral OpenOx redefines mobility and wireless capabilities. It functions as a data acquisition system, allowing for continuous real-time monitoring of blood oxygen levels via BLE, which improves the user's medical care within his or her environment as well as medical research opportunities. The standard Nellcor probe is used, which is comfortable to wear, does not restrict the user's freedom of movement, and functions as a battery-powered standalone device.


## Hardware Setup

Connection with the Arduino board is as follows:

 |OpenOx pin label| Arduino Connection  |Pin Function      |
